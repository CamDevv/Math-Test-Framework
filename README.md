# Math-Test-Framework

Welcome to Math Test Framework.
This is a very customizable math test core.

TEACHERS/ADMINS/ETC: You can use this at a school, but you should get an expert to customize this test FOR YOUR SCHOOL.
PARENTS/GUARDIANS/ETC: You can use this at home to test your kids.

This consists of only 1 script (for each language) and 3 text files (for each language) (testconfig.txt, students.txt, scores.txt)

Scores are saved to scores.txt.
Students will need to login. (make sure to set everything up in students.txt and testconfig.txt)

and uhh read the docs

You can customize the script itself.
