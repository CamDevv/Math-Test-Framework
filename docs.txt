Documentation here! The test configuration file has some useful documentation about it.

  So basically, scores are saved to scores.txt, students are in students.txt, and the configuration is in testconfig.txt.
    You can mess around with the code.

    TEST CONFIGURATION (testconfig.txt)
    - The Test Focus needs to be CAPITALISED
    - The range is the range of the first and second number of the equasion, if your range is 1,10 and you are on ADDITION, you would see questions like 5+2, 7+4, etc.
    - How many questions on the test configuration is self explanitory.
    - The completion message is what the user will see if they try to login to a student that already completed the test.
    - The Student ID length is how long a valid Student ID will be. Student IDs are a verification step after the name is entered. (IMAGE: https://github.com/CamDevv/Advanced-Math-Test/blob/main/auth.png)

    SCORES (scores.txt)
    - Scores are saved to scores.txt after the user has completed the test.
    - If a student needs to retake a test, change "True" in the completed test boolian to "False".

    STUDENTS (students.txt)
    - Student data is saved here.
    - FORMAT: {name}:{student id}:{BOOLIAN - completed test or not}
    - Example: John Doe:12345555:False
    - Make sure the boolian starts with a capital letter.
    - Make sure the name is camel case.
    - Make sure the Student ID is just numbers.

    Thats it. Thanks for using Math Test Framework!
